## Academic Projects
- **TicTacToe AI Program**: Engaged in a collaborative project to develop a TicTacToe game. My primary contribution was designing an intelligent AI bot capable of playing against human users. This bot was built using the minimax algorithm, which I enhanced with alpha-beta pruning to optimize performance and decision-making speed.
